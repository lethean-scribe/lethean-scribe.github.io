### Emerging AI Technologies in Systematic Reviews

| Technology | Current Status | Potential Application | Timeline |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|----------|
| **Large Language Models (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)** | Experimental | Question formulation, search strategy assistance, summarization, preliminary screening | Currently experimental, validation needed |
| **GPT-4 for screening** | Research phase | Automated title/abstract screening, data extraction | 1-3 years for validation |
| **Automated GRADE assessment** | Development | AI-assisted certainty of evidence rating | 2-5 years |
| **Real-time updating systems** | Early adoption | Continuous surveillance and automated updates when new studies published | Available in limited contexts |
| **Automated meta-analysis** | Research phase | Fully automated data extraction and statistical pooling | 3-5 years for clinical adoption |
| **Natural language search** | Emerging | Conversational search query building | 1-2 years for practical tools |
| **Cross-language AI** | Development | Automated translation and screening of non-English studies | 2-4 years for reliability |

### Important Considerations for AI Tool Use

**⚠️ Critical Warnings:**

1. **AI tools are assistive, not replacement**: Always have human reviewers validate AI decisions
2. **Validation required**: Check AI suggestions against known relevant studies
3. **Bias concerns**: AI tools may perpetuate biases in training data
4. **Transparency**: Document AI tool use, version, settings in methods section
5. **Quality assurance**: Conduct periodic manual checks of AI-screened citations
6. **Training data**: AI performance depends on quality of training examples
7. **Not 100% accurate**: Expect false positives and false negatives
8. **Regulatory acceptance**: Some regulatory bodies may not accept AI-only screening

**Best Practices:**
- Use AI to prioritize, not exclude without review
- Start with high-recall settings (capture everything relevant)
- Validate AI performance on subset before full deployment
- Always maintain ability to review all excluded citations
- Document AI tool parameters and version numbers
- Consider hybrid approach: AI + human verification

### Cost-Benefit Analysis: Manual vs AI-Assisted Screening

| Aspect | Traditional Manual | AI-Assisted | Hybrid Approach |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Time for 5,000 citations** | 200-300 hours | 50-100 hours | 100-150 hours |
| **Cost (2 reviewers)** | $6,000-9,000 | $1,500-3,000 | $3,000-4,500 |
| **Accuracy** | High (with training) | Variable (requires validation) | High |
| **Reviewer fatigue** | High | Low | Moderate |
| **Regulatory acceptance** | Universally accepted | Limited acceptance | Growing acceptance |
| **Reproducibility** | Moderate | High (if documented) | High |
| **Best for** | Small reviews, regulatory | Large reviews, preliminary | Most scenarios |
