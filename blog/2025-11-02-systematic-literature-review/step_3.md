STEP 1: Define Study Characteristics
        │
        ├─▶ Study Design
        │   • RCTs only?
        │   • Include observational studies?
        │   • Qualitative studies?
        │   • Mixed methods?
        │
        ├─▶ Publication Type
        │   • Peer-reviewed only?
        │   • Gray literature?
        │   • Conference abstracts?
        │   • Dissertations/theses?
        │
        └─▶ Publication Status
            • Published only?
            • Include unpublished?
            • In-press acceptable?
            │
            ▼
STEP 2: Define Population Criteria
        │
        ├─▶ Inclusion Criteria
        │   • Age range
        │   • Diagnosis/condition
        │   • Disease stage/severity
        │   • Setting
        │   • Geographic location (if relevant)
        │
        └─▶ Exclusion Criteria
            • Specific populations to exclude
            • Co-morbidities
            • Prior treatments
            │
            ▼
STEP 3: Define Intervention/Exposure
        │
        ├─▶ Intervention Characteristics
        │   • Type and description
        │   • Minimum duration
        │   • Delivery method
        │   • Intensity/dose
        │
        └─▶ Exclusion Criteria
            • Interventions to exclude
            • Co-interventions
            │
            ▼
STEP 4: Define Comparison
        │
        └─▶ Acceptable Comparators
            • Placebo
            • Standard care
            • Alternative interventions
            • No treatment
            │
            ▼
STEP 5: Define Outcomes
        │
        ├─▶ Primary Outcomes
        │   • Must be reported
        │   • How measured
        │   • Minimum follow-up
        │
        ├─▶ Secondary Outcomes
        │   • Additional outcomes of interest
        │
        └─▶ Exclusion
            • Studies without relevant outcomes
            │
            ▼
STEP 6: Define Other Criteria
        │
        ├─▶ Temporal
        │   • Date restrictions (justified)
        │
        ├─▶ Language
        │   • Languages included (team capacity)
        │
        └─▶ Other
            • Sample size minimums?
            • Follow-up duration?
            │
            ▼
STEP 7: Test Criteria
        │
        ├─▶ Apply to sample of studies
        ├─▶ Check if key studies included
        ├─▶ Check if too restrictive/permissive
        └─▶ Refine as needed

### Sample Eligibility Criteria Table

| Criterion | Inclusion | Exclusion | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Study Design** | Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental studies | Case reports, editorials, opinion pieces, narrative reviews | Need rigorous evaluation of causality |
| **Population** | Adults aged 18-75 with diagnosed type 2 diabetes (any duration, any HbA1c level) | Type 1 diabetes, gestational diabetes, prediabetes, children/adolescents | Focus on adult T2DM population |
| **Intervention** | Dietary interventions defined as Mediterranean diet pattern, lasting ≥12 weeks | Pharmaceutical interventions, surgical interventions, interventions <12 weeks, undefined "healthy" diets | Sufficient duration to see metabolic effects; need clearly defined intervention |
| **Comparison** | Any comparison diet (low-fat, low-carb, usual diet) or usual care/no intervention | No comparison group, same diet with different caloric restriction only | Need comparative data; focus on diet pattern not calories alone |
| **Outcomes** | Must report at least one glycemic outcome: HbA1c, fasting glucose, postprandial glucose, or insulin sensitivity | Studies reporting only weight, lipids, or quality of life without glycemic measures | Primary interest in metabolic/glycemic outcomes |
| **Language** | English, Spanish, French, German, Italian | All other languages | Team language capabilities; major Mediterranean diet research languages |
| **Publication Date** | January 2010 - present | Before 2010 | Major dietary guidelines updated 2010; modern diabetes management era |
| **Publication Type** | Peer-reviewed journals (full articles) | Conference abstracts without full publication, dissertations, protocols, study registrations | Need complete methodology and results for quality assessment |
| **Geographic** | No restrictions | None | Mediterranean diet applicable globally |
| **Setting** | Any setting (hospital, outpatient, community, home-based) | None | Want to capture all settings |
