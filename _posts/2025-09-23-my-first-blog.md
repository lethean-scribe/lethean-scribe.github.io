My girlfriend is learning html and css recently. I told her to follow the
video. Here, I recommend a video in Chinese that suite for fresh learners. The
name of course is Getting HTML web pages dev in 8 hours ( 8小时学会HTML网页开发
). I watched this video at very first time. The teacher named Eighteen
Swallows (燕十八). He teached very clear even himself being on screen to
show what is float or box-model.
