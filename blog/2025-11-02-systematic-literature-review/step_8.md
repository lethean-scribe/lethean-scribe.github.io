## Step 8: Assessing Study Quality and Risk of Bias

Quality assessment evaluates the methodological rigor of included studies and
helps interpret findings.

### Risk of Bias Tools by Study Design

| Study Design | Recommended Tool | Key Domains |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Randomized Controlled Trials** | Cochrane RoB 2 | Randomization, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, outcome measurement, selective reporting |
| **Non-randomized Studies** | ROBINS-I | Confounding, participant selection, intervention classification, deviations, missing data, outcome measurement, selective reporting |
| **Observational Studies** | Newcastle-Ottawa Scale | Selection, comparability, outcome/exposure |
| **Diagnostic Accuracy** | QUADAS-2 | Patient selection, index test, reference standard, flow and timing |
| **Qualitative Studies** | CASP Qualitative Checklist | Research design, data collection, trustworthiness, analysis, findings |
| **Mixed Methods** | MMAT | Appropriate rationale, integration of methods, interpretation of results, limitations |
| **Systematic Reviews** | AMSTAR 2 | Protocol registration, search comprehensiveness, study selection, quality assessment, synthesis methods |
